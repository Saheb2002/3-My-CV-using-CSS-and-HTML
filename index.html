      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a web developer specialized in the MERN stack, 
        and I have a great passion for solving problems related to 
        mathematics and physics. In addition, I also hold a deep 
        appreciation for tea‚ù§Ô∏è, especially the one that my mother makes. 
        There's nothing quite like enjoying a warm cup of tea, especially 
        when it has that personal touch.</p>

        <h3>Full-Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <p>At the age of 13, I started helping my brother with code logic. 
          Due to my talent in math and physics, I quickly developed a 
          special ability for understanding code logic and coding itself, 
          which led me to become highly proficient in back-end development. 
          Over time, I continued to gain experience with coding and 
          eventually became an experienced full-stack MERN web developer.

        <h3>Mastering the Art of Strategy</h3>
        <p>I am skilled at strategic games, having mastered Stronghold 
          Crusader and Settlers 7. Settlers 7 is my favorite and I have 
          achieved legendary status, almost unbeatable. My experience with 
          these games has improved my decision-making, foresight, and 
          adaptability, making me a formidable opponent in the digital 
          realm and real life.</p>
